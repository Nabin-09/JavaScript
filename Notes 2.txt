Scopes :
"scope" refers to the accessibility and visibility of variables and functions within your code.
It defines the context in which variables and functions are declared and where they can be accessed.
code :
Globally scoped 
// let a = 10;
// const b = 21;
// console.log(a);//10 
// console.log(b);//21
block scoped :
if(true){
    let a = 10;
    const b = 20;
    var c = 30;
}
console.log(a);//a is not defined 
console.log(c);//30 hence use of var is deprecated.
remember : Node scope and Windows scope are different.
------------------------------------------------------
Scope level and Mini Hoisting :
code : (closure of functions)
function one (){
    const username = "Nabin"
    function two (){//can access all elements of one
        const website = "youtube.com"
        console.log(username);
    }
    console.log(website);//cannot acces website outside two
    two()//prints Nabin
}
one()
code : 
 if(true){
    const username = "Nabin"
    if(username === "Nabin"){
        const website = " youtube "
        console.log(username + website);
    }
    // console.log(username + website);// cannot access website outside scope 
}
// console.log(username); throws error out of scope
Hoisting : Hoisting in JavaScript is a mechanism where variable and function 
declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means 
that regardless of where variables and functions are declared within their scope, they are treated as if they were declared at the top.
code : 
//Hoisting :
console.log(addone(5));//Prints 6 even if function is declared later
function addone (num){
    return num + 1;
}
console.log(ans);//throws error as ans is defined later and it stores values of addtwo
const ans = function addtwo(num){
    return num + 2;
}
This keyword :
console.log(this) prints {} in node environment(standalone).
if console.log(this) is ran in Console (browser) return Window object (most used global object)
 code : 
function chai(){
    let username = "Nitesh"
    console.log(this);
}
chai()
